# Write a function called calculateQuotient() that has two paramatera a and b.
# Within the function, write a return statement to return the value of a / b.
# After coding the function, write a statement to call the function using 12
# and 3 as the argumeents. Assign the result to a variable called result and
# print the value of the result

# create the calculate quotient function
def calculateQuotient(a, b):
    return a / b
    

# call the calculate Quotient function with 12 and 3 as arguments
result = calculateQuotient(12, 3)
print(f"The result is {result}, Orlando!")
